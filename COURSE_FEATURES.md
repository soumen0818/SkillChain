## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Context-Based Architecture:**
```typescript
// CourseContext provides:
- addCourse()          // Create new courses
- updateCourse()       // Modify existing courses  
- getCourseById()      // Retrieve specific course
- getTeacherCourses()  // Get courses by teacher
- deleteCourse()       // Remove courses
```

### **Data Flow:**
1. **CreateCourse** → Calls `addCourse()` → Course added to context
2. **TeacherDashboard** → Calls `getTeacherCourses()` → Displays teacher's courses
3. **CourseManagement** → Calls `getCourseById()` → Shows course details

### **Persistence:**
- **localStorage** automatically saves and loads courses
- **Default courses** provided for demonstration
- **Consistent teacher ID** ensures proper course association
